## CodePath iOS for Designers: Group Poject : Project Baton

### App Description
The Baton app helps you remember, execute and share a series of tasks, routines and information. The app will have a set of pre-configured routines that allow customization: The templated tasks/routines will come from categories like Medications, Travel, Cooking, Child care, etc. The added value here above other to-do tasks apps is that they can be shared. So if a person has to delegate tasks/information they can easily do it and ensure that all the important details are included. I see this as a simple visual interface that takes advantage of mobile device features like date/time/timers/alarms, contact information/email/text and gestures to handle features - completing a task, delegating a task.
